## About this repo:

This is where I accumulate the answers of my daily leetcode practice.  
I'm practicing leetcode daily as a way to sharpen my development skills  
and stay in "shape".

I started practicing using python but right now I'm challenging myself  
by doing it in Rust. Rust is a pretty fun and sometimes frustrating language,  
but I feel like by learning and practicing rust I'm letting myself open for any  
unexpected opportunities in the future.
