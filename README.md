## About this repo:

This is where I accumulate the answers of my daily leetcode pratice.  
I'm praticing leetcode daily as a way to sharpen my development skills  
and stay in "shape".

I started praticing using python but right now I'm challenging myself  
by doing it in Rust. Rust is a pretty fun and sometimes frustating language,  
but I feel like by learning and praticing rust I'm letting myself open for any  
unespected oportunities in the future.
