## Notes to how to become a web developer in 2024

he got 100k job in 3 years. I'm currently one year in the road

### Getting a remote job come down to three main pillars.

- **Strategy** (the game plan) WHAT to do to start from 0 andturn yourself into a new person in 12 months.

- **Desired Developer** How to become a developer that the companies want so badly? You achive that by learning how to learn 

- **Mindset** Learning mind tools to kill the competition, things will get hard and I have to know how to avoid faliure when things get hard.

## Pillar 1: Strategy (the game plan)

1) What exactly does a web dev do?

I have to make my final goal clear, so I can focus on reaching it.

**What does a web dev do?**  
Builds web applications.

**What is an application?**  
An application is a piece of software/code that others code/software can interact with.

**What is a web application?**  
A web application is an application that runs in the browser (chrome, firefox, safire etc)

**What isn't an application?**  
Even though we are using the same core three technologies, we are accomplishing different things.  
Websites are made to tipically market a product or service, while applications are made so the user can do some sort of work or process, or for entertainment purposes.
For example twitter is an application, because people use twitter as a product, youtube is an application, a portifolio page is an website, my easyGym project is an webapp

**What skills do I need to become a web developer?**  
1) the core languages: html, css, javascript
2) Libraries
3) Programming principles

JS is what pays the bill, you have to be good at css and html but they don't care if you are super good at them.

**Super Important** I'll not get a job by just knowing js, html, css. They are the fundamental but they are not enough.

The next step is to learn a library like React.

**What is a programming library?**  
A programming library is a collection of pre-build functions, with a standardized way of writing code to achive a goal.

HTML -> css -> JS -> React -> Typescript

**Warning** at this point I'm just starting out, 99% of self taught or booties stop here and start applying for jobs. This is just the beggining.

Knowing how to use these technologies and having some sort of prof that I know how to use them is the next step.

## WHAT DO EMPLOYERS ACTUALLY WANT?

I don't need a portifolio, or go to a local coffee shop and make a website for them or freelance on uptowork to gain experience. All this stuff sounds good but it's not relevant to the real world.

If you have a portifolio you label yourself as a junior witch nobody wants anyway. No "real" developer have a portifolio website.

My job as a developer is not to build or design websites so I'm wasting time by doing that. I'm a web application developer!!

Grinding uptowork requires money to apply to jobs. The jobs are too easy and the competition is insane because you're fighting third worlders from india and Pakistan that do the job for 5$.

Companies don't want to hire juniors because they're gamble, they might or they might not work out.  
They Cost a lot of money because besides their salaries, senior developers need to to take time away from their work to help out the juniors. Basically I need to know how to do the job before having the job.

I need to make one solid application that shows you mean buisines, you know your stuff and can deliver work right away.

This is how I become different from the majority of people. If I look at it this way then I'll realize that I have 0 competition.

99% of people are completely clueless.

I have to create a super good itecactive webapp, I can copy ideas from https://ads.legalify.pro/?ref=producthunt  
I can find examples in producthunt

### Principles of the app
- has a usecase
- long time to build, up to tree months, even more
- It's complex, there's a lot of code, a lot of code means that I can work in a big codebase, I'll be working on projects that have hundreds of files
- User friendly
- Looks good

Optional (but high leverage)
- work in a team of 4 people
- Adopt agile methodologies

I'll go from junior to midlevel

I'm competing in a world where people wants skyscrapers but I'm only building igloos.

When the product is the goal I'll naturally learn the in-damand tech.

## Getting the job

1 - For what jobs should I apply?  
2 - how do I apply and how do I stand out to recruiters
3 - how to pass the interview

### For what jobs should I apply?
any job that is in web development (frontend, backend or fullstack), any library (react, angular, vue)

### How do I apply and how to stand out to recruiters? + How to pass the interview

Automate what is possible (https://lazyapply.com/)
Network + notion + interview prep calls

### How to get a raise or how to negotiate better condition such as working remotely?

I have to be good at what I do. Simple as that

## Pillar 2: how to become a Developer that companies want so badly?

How t obecome a 6 figure developer? Acquire the skills of a 6 fig developer. So it's all about your ability to learn fast and well

**What does learning mean?**

Learning is defined by the change in behaivor of a person when exposed to a stimulus.

The only two frameworks that I need to know to become and expert in cooding fast to get a job is:

- First principles thinking
- Mental athletic drilling

### First principles thinking

First principle thinking is a way of thinking that tell us to break every problem in it's smallest components.

Break down the problem in the smallest pieces possible. Define the problem then start researching the potential solution.

This is the first reason that every aspiring developer gets stuck in the tutorial hell. They try to learn everything. Just in case they need said technology instead of learning just in time or when they need it.

They start with the code editor instead of the problem.

### Mental athletic drilling and volume

Quote: it's better to solve one problem five different ways than to solve five problems one way. The only "secret" to get good at something is to do it untill you get bored of it. And when you get bored of it you do more of it.

Nothing can beat hours and hours put into an application. Nothing can beat someone that does more than another person.

What most people do wrong is that they build half a bridge here. half a bridge there. but they never get on the other side of the river, they never really get it

When I feel insecure about something. Let's say my CSS skills. Instead of hidding it under the rug, attack it without any mercy. Spend 2 days trying to really learn all the stuff you're insecure about. This is what 99% of people will brush about. I'm insecure about my AWS knowledge so let's attack it without any mercy.

### AI

Ai will kill a bunch of developers and aspiring developers.

No more critical thinking

I need suffering and pain to learn something. Is the amount of friction, it's like going to the gym, it's not good, it's not pelasurable but the effort and pain from the exercise is what make I grow the muscle. It's like when I'm dooing squartss, there's fear, there's effort, there's pain, but I do it anyway.

## Pillar 3: Mindtools to kill the competition

*Success is guaranteed, speed is not.*

All me and you hava to do is to do the things that we are supposed to do, to the best of our abilities for as long as possible so we can get the outcome that we want.

Start measuring your success by your actions that you're taking to get to your goal.

The first mind tool: Prespective: Macro wins vs Micro wins.
> I'll not achive the desired outcome everyday, like when I went reading manwa all the day

> Zoom out, to see what I've done already and my overall progress

The second mindtool: Consistence

> Consistency in showing up everyday

> Consistency in progress  
I want to get better every single day, every single week, every single month, always having something to push forward and not getting stagnated

The third mind tool: Patience

- Dooing the thing without expecting the result right away
- Not stop dooing thing while awaiting for the outcome

### It's hard

Who here thought it would be easy?  
Who here thought this would be hard?  
This is how hard feels like -> you just didn't know how "hard" felt like.

You might be at that point in your cooding journey:

- You might be stuck getting started
- You might be stuck not getting interviews
- you might be stuck not passing interviews


### Takes too long

No one plants a seed and expect to eat the fruit on the same day

What makes things hard is not complexity. It's consistency

Sometimes you have to keep doing it before you get anything back

This is what o signed up for, and this is what makes it worth it

The Process is simple: Learn how to code and get a developer job

Start by doing the basics, implement the basics untill you're comfortable with them. Slowly build more complex projects. Then try getting an interview. If you don't get interviews, your project/resume is not strong enough or you don't put yourself out there enough, or both. If you don't pass interviews then you don't have social skills or don't know how to express your technical knowledge, or both.

Using first principles, you can tweak all these problems and get better. There's no magic trick or silver bullet, just a million golden BB's.
